    Dear shreya,

<p>I am writing this letter with a heavy heart, knowing that I have hurt you deeply in the past. I want to apologize for all the mistakes I have made and the pain that I have caused you. Looking back, I can see how my behavior was wrong and I deeply regret it.
</p>
<p>I know that you have every reason not to trust me and that you may be hesitant to give me another chance. But I want to assure you that I am committed to making things right and improving myself for our future together.

</p>
<p>I don't even know where to begin, but I know that I have hurt you deeply and I am truly sorry. As Selena Gomez once said, "The heart wants what it wants," and my heart wants you.
</p>
<p>I have made mistakes in the past and I know that I have let you down. But I want you to know that I am willing to do whatever it takes to make things right between us. I know that it won't be easy, but I believe that we can work through this together.</p>

<p>As Detective Terry Jeffords from B 99 once said, "Mistakes are like bad smells: They linger and they stink." I know that I made some mistakes that really hurt you, but I promise that I will do everything in my power to make sure those mistakes don't happen again.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez also said, "I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried." I want you to know that I still believe in us, and I am willing to try as many times as it takes to make things right. I believe that our love is worth fighting for, and I am willing to put in the work to make it happen.</p>

<p>I also remember a scene from The Office where Jim Halpert finally confesses his feelings to Pam Beesly, saying, "I'm in love with you. I think you're incredible. And I'm not the only guy who thinks that. And I know that you don't feel the same way about me, but I just needed you to know." I'm not confessing my love to you, but I want you to know how much you mean to me, and how much I want us to be together again.</p>

<p>I understand that I have a lot of work to do in order to regain your trust, but I promise to do everything in my power to make things right. I will be patient, kind, and understanding as we work through this together.</p>

<p>I know it might be too late for this or you have already made up your mind but trust me the past was difficult for both of us specially for you , but now we genuienly have a opportunity to turn this around and make it work for real . You take the back seat you enjoy just let me do everything now.</p>

<p>I miss you more than words can describe, and I hope that we can find a way to move forward together. Please consider giving me another chance, and I promise that I will not let you down again.</p>


Sincerely,
T
